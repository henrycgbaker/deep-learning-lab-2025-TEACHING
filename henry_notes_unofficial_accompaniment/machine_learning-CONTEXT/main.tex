        This document provides a self-contained treatment of core machine learning concepts: model training and optimisation, high-dimensional learning, generalisation and overfitting, kernel methods, decision trees, ensemble methods, fairness, uncertainty quantification, and neural networks. These notes serve as foundational prerequisite material for the Deep Learning course.

        \textbf{Disclaimer:} Personal notes made available to students for lab work. May contain mistakes - please flag any you find. Content occasionally goes beyond Hertie course requirements as I have developed these to support my own research. Not a substitute for official materials.
